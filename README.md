![Framework Overview](./image.png)  

This repository contains the implementation of **PSW-I**, a novel framework for robust and effective imputation of missing values in time-series data. The approach is built upon the **Proximal Spectrum Wasserstein (PSW)** discrepancy, tailored to address key challenges in time-series imputation.  

## Abstract  
Missing data imputation through distribution alignment has demonstrated advantages for non-temporal datasets but exhibits suboptimal performance in time-series applications. The primary obstacle is crafting a discrepancy measure that simultaneously:  
1. Captures **temporal patterns**â€”accounting for periodicities and temporal dependencies inherent in time-series.  
2. Accommodates **non-stationarity**, ensuring robustness amidst multiple coexisting temporal patterns.  

In response to these challenges, we introduce the **Proximal Spectrum Wasserstein (PSW)** discrepancy based on the stochastic optimal transport framework. PSW integrates:  
- **Pairwise spectral distance** to encapsulate temporal patterns.  
- **Selective matching regularization** to accommodate non-stationarity.  

Building on PSW, we propose the **PSW-I** framework, which iteratively refines imputation results by minimizing the PSW discrepancy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PSW-I effectively addresses these challenges and significantly outperforms prevailing time-series imputation methods.  

## Key Features  
- **Temporal Pattern Capturing**: Utilizes spectral distances to understand time-series periodicities and dependencies.  
- **Non-Stationarity Adaptation**: Incorporates selective matching for robustness across varied temporal patterns.  
- **Iterative Refinement**: Refines imputed values progressively for enhanced accuracy.  
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets.  



## Usage  
### Data Preparation  
Prepare your time-series dataset with missing values following the format in `out_data/`.  
then use
```bash  
python process_data.py --dataset dataset_name
```  
### Running the Model  
To run PSW-I for imputation:  
```bash  
sh scripts/etth1.sh
```
